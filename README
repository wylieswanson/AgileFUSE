AgileFUSE is a module and command that provides a FUSE abstraction of the 
Agile Cloud Storage, commonly known as a 'mounted' network filesystem on a 
native filesystem.  It leverages the AgileCLU python module and associated 
configuration files.

At present, it provides a read-only filesystem.  It has been tested on 
Linux and Mac OS X (and can be configured to appear on the OS X desktop).
